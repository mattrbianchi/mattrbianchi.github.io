  <h1> Treat Your Brain Like A Codebase </h1>

  <div id=sub-header>
    January 2017 Â· 5 minute read
  </div>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This post stems from me finding this <a href="https://youtu.be/FKTxC9pl-WM?list=PL3NQHgGj2vtuWPOxUMGwvRuEB0KVg-UXT">conference talk</a>. It would be best for you to watch it first and then come back but don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s pretty funny and really enlightening.</p>

<p>Now, after watching that talk, I realized that ever since I started to learn how to program, I was dying the death of a thousand micro-leaks because there was so much I didn&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ve all been in that boat before: &ldquo;Well, real programmers use the terminal.&rdquo; So Matt does his best to learn the terminal, while trying to learn how to code <em>and</em> learn the concepts of computer architecture <em>and</em> keep up with engineering physics <em>and&hellip;</em> You get my point. Yeah, I learned <code>ls</code>. And of course I learned the material in my classes. But I was no where near mastering a terminal. _ I was piling up on B_. And I was in double trouble because I was so concerned with everything I didn&rsquo;t know that the things I thought I <em>did</em> know ended up in the &ldquo;Half-assed on C&rdquo; category. &ldquo;Ok, Matt, I get it&hellip; you&rsquo;re an idiot. What did you do about it?&rdquo; Please, read on.</p>

<p>As a programmer, we get pulled all kinds of different ways with what we should or shouldn&rsquo;t know. So the first task that Kathy issues us with in that video is pulling stuff off B. All during college, I found odd jobs writing programs for various companies. So in college, I was writing mainly Java with some Python, C++, and even less C. But I would take semesters off through a co-op program and dive into C# and the .NET framework because evidently that&rsquo;s the only thing people in Alabama will pay programmers do. <em>Seriously, my friend and I refer to the area as the .NET belt in a very distasteful manner</em>. These programs would be websites (because everything is a website now) so they also needed HTML, CSS, and of course JS skills. Then, to top it off, I&rsquo;m one of those people who have the bad habit of seeing everything as a challenge and so the &ldquo;Real programmers do X&rdquo; statements really got to me. &ldquo;Real programmers are all doing mobile development&rdquo;. So I dove into the Android environment until I saw the divine light and gave my soul to Apple, but then in order to be a <em>real programmer</em> I needed to now learn the iOS environment. &ldquo;Real programmers learn vim&rdquo;. &ldquo;Real programmers program on a *nix environment&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s funny that Kathy refers to compensating with food, because that&rsquo;s exaclty what I did during this time. Then, the nail in the coffin was my last semester. That semester was the most rewarding in my undergrad, but it was not a walk in the park. One class was using F#, the other Python and Java, we decided on Rails for our senior design project (I would also end up the sole developer of the iOS app, where I lost a week of sleep learning the new swift language because that&rsquo;s what real iOS programmers do), and we were goaded by another &ldquo;Real programmers write documents in LaTeX&rdquo; statement so by god our senior project documentation would be an immaculate PDF written in LaTeX.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this extreme tour I put myself through was a great self discovering process. It was not however a healthy one. I gained 40lbs over my undergrad and ended up losing 20lbs of that my last semester because I only had time for a big breakfast in the morning and what I still affectionately call my coffee lunches. All this focus and time wasted could have been better used had I not piled up on B. Before encountering this talk, I had already finished The Pragmatic Programmer which advises a developer to pick their tools wisely and stick with them, especially your text editor. So I was already pulling stuff off B by working a full time job in one language and finally taking on one editor, vim, even though I didn&rsquo;t know I was doing it at the time. But I still struggled with encountering things I didn&rsquo;t know in vim, in git, in a shell, etc. But when working a full time job, I felt pressured to deliver and sitting down to learn would pull me away from getting something delivered. This is where this talk really changed my process.</p>

<p>Kathy made me realize that I could look at improving my skills like improving a codebase. I immediately made a Trello board with columns &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Do&rdquo;, &ldquo;Learning&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mastered&rdquo;. While at work, if I came upon something I couldn&rsquo;t do in vim where I had to break down and use another editor, I immediately put that &ldquo;issue&rdquo; into my Can&rsquo;t Do column. Then I could track what I didn&rsquo;t know and come back to it after I was done bringing a previous skill into the Mastered column and effectively closing it out. This has brought my productivity and capability to another level where I am finally comfortable with git, the shell, vim, and even another editor that I&rsquo;ve made my main text editor. I also concentrated all my efforts into one programming language, Go, which has given me the priviledge to work in it full time. And finally, to fix my &ldquo;Half-assed on C&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going back to school for my masters through the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech. With having git, the shell, an editor, and the language I use at work officially under my belt, I plan to keep my focus strictly on this masters degree where I can bring the concepts of computer science I left on B to C.</p>
